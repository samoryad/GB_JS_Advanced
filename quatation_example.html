    <p>Замена одинарных кавычек на двойные

        (Улучшить шаблон так, чтобы в конструкциях типа aren't одинарная кавычка не
        заменялась на двойную).

    'There was a storm last night,' Paul said.
    Peter, however, didn't believe him. 'I'm not sure that's exactly what happened.'
    Peter was aware of what he called 'Paul's weakness triangle': he was half deaf, slept like a log, and was prone to lying.
    Paul saw an argument coming, so he muttered only 'But I saw it'; this was going to be a long night and he didn't want to start it with a fight.
    Question marks and exclamation points have their own rules.
    If they apply to the quoted material, they go within the quotation marks.If they apply to the whole sentence, they go outside it:
    Sandy asked them, 'Why do you guys always fight?'
    Did the dog bark every time he heard Sandy say 'I'm bringing dinner'?
